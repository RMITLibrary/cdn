		<div>Using Asset Tags and Labels to Track and Manage Your Equipment and Resources Efficiently
If you operate a business that uses, owns or rents out a lot of physical assets, then you have probably wondered about asset tags. Also known as asset management labels, these help companies to keep track of their indoor/outdoor assets. They ensure that every item is monitored and maintained properly. 

 The Main Types of Labels
Asset tags or labels may be classified based on their use, the information they contain or their format. They can be used for inventory, for maintenance, for safety, for instructions, for digital systems and more.</div>
