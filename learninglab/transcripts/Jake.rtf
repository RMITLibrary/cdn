So academic integrity to me? Well coming from high school its obviously meant something differently.\
Obviously plagiarism and coming out with original thoughts and not stealing people's work is like a central idea in academic integrity. But as you come into university it comes to be more of an attitude towards working more broadly. And it's kind of how you develop your ideas and like the thoroughness of your thinking and all of the things that you've taken and all of the voices you've integrated into your work and then giving them proper credit and showing people the influences that have helped you to come to your conclusions in your work. The advice I would give to students coming into university around academic integrity would be to not be afraid. In some ways it's a process, it's ongoing and it's a skill that you develop and learn as you go through your university and academic career. So all in all academic integrity, it's a gradual thing you'll build up and it's it's a broad overarching concept that should guide you through your university life.\
And referencing and using proper referencing style is one of the greatest tools you have in your arsenal in terms of maintaining your academic integrity.\
 It's just as simple as showing your train of thought through your research and giving people credit for the thinkers that came before you.\
