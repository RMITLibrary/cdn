		<div>Activity Introduction</div>
		<div>Start</div>
		<div>In this activity, you will be presented with three scenarios.

Read the scenarios and choose the best answer based on whether each one shows collaboration or collusion.</div>
		<div>Question 1</div>
		<div>Avoiding Academic Misconduct</div>
		<div>Collaboration or Collusion?</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>Submit</div>
		<div>Wrong.

This is collusion because the results are not from Sharifa’s own work. Even though Melissa offered her results, the experiment and report were supposed to be done individually.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Question 1 of 3</div>
		<div>Sharifa has been asked to redo the assigned experiment and resubmit her lab report. Her friend, Melissa, offers to give Sharifa the results from her own experiment instead. Sharifa uses Melissa’s results in her lab report then resubmits the report to her teacher.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Question 2</div>
		<div>Correct!

This is collusion because the results are not from Sharifa’s own work. Even though Melissa offered her results, the experiment and report were supposed to be done individually.</div>
		<div>Collaboration</div>
		<div>Collusion</div>
		<div>Does this show collaboration or collusion?</div>
		<div>You have completed</div>
		<div>Click ‘Mark as done’ above to continue.</div>
		<div>Xiao asked Lucas to "fix up" her essay, asking Lucas to look at the spelling and grammar in particular. Lucas rewrote most of the essay, changing a lot of the text. Xiao submitted the essay under her name.</div>
		<div>Question 3</div>
		<div>Question 2 of 3</div>
		<div>Correct!

This is collusion because Lucas is not the author and the work is not entirely Xiao’s.

It would have been okay had Lucas proofread the spelling and grammar only.</div>
		<div>Wrong.

		<div>Finish</div>
		<div>Xiao, Lucas and Sharifa are writing a group research report. They planned the project together and divided the tasks between them. Xiao did most of the research and discussed the findings with Lucas and Sharifa. Lucas and Sharifa decided to do a bit more research because there was some information missing. Once they had agreed on the content, each person wrote their part of the report, based on the research. Sharifa and Lucas then edited the final report, including all of their names, before Xiao submitted it on the group’s behalf.</div>
		<div>Question 3 of 3</div>
		<div>Correct!

This is collaboration because it was a group assignment that all the group members participated in, from the planning through to submission and all their names appeared on the final assignment.</div>
