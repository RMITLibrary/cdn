[Speaker: Dr Kristen Sharp]\
We live in a contemporary context so it's incredibly easy to copy and paste materials online, particularly visual materials and everything seems freely available and everyone's reposting, reusing and recycling this material. However, when we come into an academic environment, like at university, suddenly we're required to consider the legal and ethical requirements around using that material and questions arise as to whether the material. Is it freely available? Who actually has, who's the original creator and author of that work and how do we attribute and acknowledge that authorship in our own work. Whether it's in writing an essay, or whether it's how do we acknowledge it when we've used that work in an artwork for instance.\
[Speaker: Dr Lucas Parker]\
It's just people from different backgrounds and even different home lives. The way that you interact with people, the way that you converse with people is the way that you're going to attribute knowledge or attribute where you've found out information. Sometimes you're scared to go and say such-and-such said this because actually you're worried that it may weaken your argument. Or it might not look as though you know what you're talking about because you're referring to somebody else.\
[Speaker: Dr Juliana Ryan]\
When you come to uni you become part of an academic community. It could be the discipline community or the academic community of your degree program, or even the school in which you're enrolled. And like other communities, academic communities have shared ways of working and shared values. And academic integrity is the place where those shared values and those shared ways of working really come together. So, the key values that underpin academic integrity are, honesty, openness and trustworthiness or trust.\
[Speaker: Associate Professor Scott Brook]\
Academic integrity is a real-world skill and your career could depend on it.\
