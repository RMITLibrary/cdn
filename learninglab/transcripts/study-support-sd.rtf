Study Support Services
 
All RMIT students have access to a range of library and study support services.  
 
Getting help is easy. The Library and Study Support team are ready to help you online. 
 
Even though you can’t physically visit the Library and Study Support Hub right now, you can still get help from Librarians and Academic Skills Advisors online through our “Ask the Library” chat service. 
 
During semester, Chat is available Melbourne time, Monday to Friday from 9am to 8.30pm, and on weekends and public holidays from 10am to 4.30pm. 
 
Librarians are information specialists. They’re great at helping you find and evaluate information to use in your assignments: what to look for, where to find it and whether it is credible.  
  
Academic skill advisors can guide you with writing, maths, physics or strategies to improve your online study skills and academic work.   
 
You can also get feedback on your assignments by attaching a copy of your draft and the assignment brief.  
  
Let Ask the Library know exactly what type of help you need and they will connect you to the best study support person  
  
Before you ask for help from Ask the Library, you might find an answer to your question through the RMIT Learning Lab. Just do a search for RMIT Learning Lab on the RMIT website.  
 
You’ll find a wide range of resources to help you improve your general academic study, writing and maths, statistics, and physics skills.  
 
Most of the material here is applicable to any discipline, but you may find information that is targeted specifically to your coursework too. It's well worth exploring.  
 
We also have plenty of online tools to help you with your studies.   
EasyCite makes referencing easy, and our Assignment Planner gives you a customised step-by-step plan with tips and advice for completing your presentations and written assignments.  
 
A fun way to get to know the Library is to play the Library Quest game.  
 
Good luck with your studies at RMIT University. We look forward to chatting with you soon!
