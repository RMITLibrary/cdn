[Context]Our friendship started in art school, our early experimentation was Mossy's first exploration in performative movement. Mossy states this was an important moment in her coming into womanhood and comfort in her body.\'a0\'a0[end Context]\
\'a0\
[What]In this work, I have translated Mossy's spoken word poem into a digital portrait.[end What] [Rationale] It has been an opportunity to demystify and humanise the concept of a trans-woman and to show the complexity of her identity, be it objectified, demonised, hyper-sexualised in her vulnerability, beauty, and strength.[end Rationale] [What]Through our intimate exchange via the lens, this work contains visual symbols that reference our historical collaborations and celebrates our friendship.\'a0\'a0\'a0\
