This video covers different types of legislation and where to find them.

When searching for legislation there are some important things to consider.
  
Most states and territories will have their own legislation, so check that you're accessing legislation in the correct jurisdiction.

Make sure youâ€™re accessing the most up to date or authorised version of the act, with all amendments incorporated,

unless you specifically need an older version of the act that was in force when the crime was committed. 
 
Each state, territory and the federal government has a website where you can access their legislation.

Most of these provide the authorised version of the act as well as previous or historical versions.

The LawOne database, linked from the law and justice subject guide, is only available to RMIT staff and students.

LawOne not only provides access to current legislation but also additional and related sources

such as draft legislation, parliamentary speeches and explanatory memorandums.

You'll also find links to case law where the legislation has been discussed.

The easiest way to search this database is to Browse by jurisdiction and then use the alphabetical list to locate the relevant Act.

One of the best features of LawOne is Key info, where you can download and access the original, current and historical versions of the Act

as well as historical information about the act, the original Bill, second reading speech from parliament and materials that help explain the legislation.
