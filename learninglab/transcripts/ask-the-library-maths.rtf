Student 1: I don’t understand any of this! 

I thought I did yesterday during the lecture, but now I just don’t get it! 
I wish I could get some help! 

Student 2: You can get help from teachers experienced in maths, statistics, physics and chemistry! 
 
I found them through Ask the Library on the RMIT library website. 
 
They were great! They worked through the questions with me and showed me how to tackle my worksheet. 
 
Student 1: That sounds great! Did you have to wait long? 
 
Student 2: Not at all! Ask the Library usually finds a teacher who’ll contact you within a couple of hours, or early the next day. 
 
Student 1: I'll get on to them right now!
