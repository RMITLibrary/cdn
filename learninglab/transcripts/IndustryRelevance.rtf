You might think academic integrity only relates to university study, however being aware of where content comes from is crucial to working in the creative industries. Academic integrity trains you to be aware of where content comes from, who made and owns what, and this is really important for careers in the creative sector. For instance, if you've created some original content, perhaps a video or feature article, then you or the organization you work for will most likely have intellectual property rights in that work. The right to reproduce the work, copyright, is a source of income and is protected. Content creators can also have what's called a moral right, protected in law, to be acknowledged as the creators of their work. This is how the reputation of creatives grows. Through being acknowledged for the work they've made in the past.\

And it is important as a practicing artist or a creative practitioner that you're able to demonstrate that you can operate in that professional environment to acknowledge those influences. \

Prior to becoming an academic I worked for around about 10 years in a variety of different communications roles. I'd like to share with you a brief example of how these principles of academic integrity apply beyond a university setting, in a professional context. In this particular example we were producing a brochure that highlighted our work in indigenous communities where we operated. There was a great photo that we wanted to use alongside our brochure of an indigenous girl jumping on a trampoline. However, even though this image appeared in our corporate image library we were unable to find the source of the image, as well as who the girl was and whether she provided consent for us to use her photo in this way. We could have taken the easy route and simply used the image because it after all was in the corporate image library. However, we decided that the risk to our reputation potentially of doing so was too great. So, we decided not to use this image and instead to source a different image, where we were confident of who'd taken the photo but more importantly that the person in it had provided us their consent to use the image.\

In the creative sector reputation stands for a lot.  Being known as someone who acknowledges the work of others by your peers is the best way to grow your own reputation and career. Academic integrity is a real-world skill and your career could depend on it.\
