Academic integrity means acting with honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research.

This includes doing your own original work, respecting and acknowledging the work of other people, and clearly stating when you use someone else's ideas, words or images by citing correctly in the body of your work and referencing your sources accurately.

Academic integrity involves recognising people and publications that have influenced your thinking and taking personal responsibility for the way you behave in an academic context.

It's important to complete individual assignments on your own or acknowledge who you work with in group assignments.

You should always behave with integrity in exams and assessments.

Failing to recognise someone else’s ideas by: not referencing, dishonestly working with another student on an individual assignment, or cheating on an exam or assignment, can result in a charge of Academic Misconduct.

Other examples include paying or asking someone to write an assignment for you or attempting to bribe someone in the academic community.

Academic Misconduct can have serious consequences for both your academic and professional career.

In some academic cultures, copying content may be seen as honoring the creator.

However, at RMIT you must clearly state where ideas, words and images originated because they belong to the person or people who created them.

Everyone has a responsibility for maintaining academic integrity, but don't worry, there's lots of support available.

You can ask your tutor or lecturer to clarify the task.

You can also take your assignment to the study support hub for extra help or use the Ask the Library online chat service.

While they can’t write the content for you, they can help you with structure and grammar.

By strengthening your understanding of academic integrity, you can develop skills which will be valuable throughout your work and life.
