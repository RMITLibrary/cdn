\f0\fs24 \cf0 And I think that television, the telly, really helped me to improve my English as well.  Like the listening or probably the listening and speaking.  Because I remembered my home stay mother or my teacher suggesting to me to look at the news.  Because sometimes they have the subtitles, I think when you have the television you can choose subtitle and you will know what they\'92re talking about.  If you don\'92t know you can check your dictionary- this kind of stuff.  And yeah the telly really helped. I watched Big Brother because it\'92s a really fun show.  It\'92s really local so you understand and you learn the way they speak.\
