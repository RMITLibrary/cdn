Your talk may be a group effort and this introduces organizational issues that can make or break the success of your presentation.\
\
It's not appropriate to dissect the talk like a cake and distribute the parts to individual members to take care of.\
\
The body needs to be worked on by everyone collaboratively.\
\
Specific sections of the body may be divided between your team to be deeply researched or delivered.\
\
But at some stage you need to regroup to put those pieces back together again.\uc0\u8232 \
 \
First of all, you need to be able to meet face-to-face preferably, and it would be good to have a regular time when this is convenient for all of you.\
\
At least once each week.\
\
Don\'92t forget to exchange phone numbers and emails as well.\uc0\u8232 \
If this is not a familiar topic, everyone should just go there own way at first and read broadly to get a feel for the area.\
\
But sharing any articles are particularly good of course.\uc0\u8232 \
\
You need to regroup soon, and decide what two to four topics should be covered.\
\
That is, if these are not already specified by your lecturer and it would be excellent to agree on a central message before you start writing the body, if possible.\uc0\u8232 \
\
If you want a central theme, this should be defined early on if you can to guide people's research from the beginning.\
\
When the topics are decided you can go your own way and research your section deeply.\
\
Keep in touch regularly with any of the other group members, whose area may overlap yours.\
\
because you don\'92t want to repeat material.\uc0\u8232 \
\
It is most satisfying and effective if you get to talk on the topic that you have researched yourself.\
\
You want to sound like the expert.\
\
Remember not to measure your contribution to the group in terms of minutes standing up in speaking.\
\
This is never the hardest part.\
\
The hardest part lies in the researching, collaboration and preparation of visual resources.\uc0\u8232 \
\
Once the body of your talk is defined, the group should get together and outline the introduction and conclusion together.\
\
One person might write from the perspective of the part that they researched, and introductions and conclusions need to have a sense of overview.\uc0\u8232 \
\
Writing the introduction and conclusion will be easy once the body is done.\
\
But they are almost impossible to write in isolation from the body.\
\
In the next chapter we will be looking at part two of oral presentations a sample structure.\
