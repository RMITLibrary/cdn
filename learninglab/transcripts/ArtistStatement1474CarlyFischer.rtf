Carly Fischer - Artist Biography (
\f2\b0 299 words)\
\
[Who]Carly Fischer is a sculptural and audio installation artist from Melbourne, Australia.[end Who] [What]Her work explores the smaller details, peripheries and hidden histories of places, creating alternate narratives that question broader cultural and colonial perspectives. Engaging with environments through a fragmentary and meandering process of encountered objects, materials, sounds and histories, her sculptural and sonic reconstructions reflect on places as complex and shifting sites of accumulation, interaction and negotiation. Since 2011, her works have often included collaborations with sound artists.[end What]\
\
[Where]Carly has exhibited widely in Australia, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, Scotland, Japan and the US through solo, group and collaborative projects and residencies, including recent exhibitions at Bus Projects, Incinerator Gallery, Bundoora Homestead Art Centre, BLINDSIDE, Melbourne, Centre for Contemporary Art, Glasgow, The Art Gallery of Ballarat, Warrnambool Art Gallery, Gippsland Art Gallery, Watch This Space, Alice Springs, KWADRAT and REH Kunst, Germany and MU Artspace, the Netherlands.[end Where] [Collaborations]Her sculptural and audio installations often include collaborations with sound artists. Her recent collaboration with audio visual artist Edwina Stevens 'I feel the earth move under my feet', created in response to a residency at Melbourne's Living Museum of the West and exhibited at Incinerator Gallery in 2019, was included in Radiophrenia, Centre for Contemporary Art, Glasgow, with their following collaboration 'Conversation Piece' exhibited at Bus Projects in 2021.[end Collaboration] [Achievements] Carly has also been a finalist in prizes such as The 2017 Guirguis New Art Prize, The Art Gallery of Ballarat and The 2018 Incinerator Art Award with her work 'Creating False Memories for a Place That Never Was', in collaboration with sound artist Mieko Suzuki.
