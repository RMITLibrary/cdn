As a student do you ever feel like you're drowning in a sea of information?

I know I did.

There's so much out there but I never knew
how to tell whether it was any good. 

Then the library threw me a lifeline.

I found my subject guide!

Subject guides are mini websites for each subject area.

They show you all the best places to look for information on what you're studying.

This includes the best journals, websites, conference papers, e-books, books and more, 

whatever is relevant to what you're studying.

Subject guides and made by librarians, experts in finding information in your area, so you know what you're searching will be good quality.

For my next assignment I skipped Google and started with my subject guide.
 
I saved heaps of time by heading straight for the quality resources.

Now assignment time isn't overwhelming because I know I can get to the right information when I need it.

It makes all the difference when you know where to start.
