[Context] VERMIN (Lia\'a0Tabrah) and Jenny were drawn together by Lia\'92s Gold Croc Jewellery. Field trips eventuated to Darwin, Alice Springs, Uluru, and BALI. They both love lurid pinks. Jenny\'92s 1970s Punk,\'a0pink business card to Lia\'92s vintage pink garments. [end Context] [Rationale] The more extreme and unimaginable is where their aesthetic emerges. Lia and Jenny connect in art and style. Both use the human body as the canvas to convey their wearable art. They both like to push the envelope and get high on the fruits of their imaginations with many LOLs in the background. \'93Pleasure and ingrained style more like it. We are not\'a0Farshun!!\'94\'a0[end Rationale]\

[Content]This exhibition waved a red flag for VERMIN and Jenny to go all out, with Lia\'92s Cane Toad medium and Jenny\'92s dress construction. Ideas blossom on the construction journey, the toads go \'93PUNK PINK.\'94 Their legs become fringe, the dress shimmies. Metal plated genuine toad heads feature. Jenny\'92s 1980s Punk breast plates make a comeback.\'a0[end Content]\
