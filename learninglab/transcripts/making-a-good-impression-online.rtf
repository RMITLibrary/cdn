G’day, I’m Tull!

In this video I’m going to give you some
tips on how to make a good impression online.

It’s important to remember that university
is an academic and professional space.

You could be studying among future employers
or colleagues.

So how can you put your best foot forward
online?

When you’re speaking, it’s nice to turn
your camera on if you can, so that your classmates

and teacher can get to know you.

Position the camera so that you are facing
straight on,

it might help to prop your laptop or computer
up with a stand or some books.

Try sitting in front of a window so that the
natural sunlight lights your face.

Think about your background.

What’s behind you?

Can you angle yourself so that you have a
neutral background?

Of course, it’s not always possible to turn
your camera on or sit in front of a window

or have a nice background but just do your
best and don’t let this stop you 

from contributing in class.

It’s also helpful to mute your microphone
when you aren’t speaking.

This minimises the background noise for everyone
else.

If your teacher puts you in a breakout room,

it can help you to engage with your group
members if you switch your camera on.

If you can’t switch your camera on, that’s
OK!

Just let your group members know that you’re
still there, you’re listening, 

and you’re ready to talk.

Always try to be culturally sensitive and
use inclusive language when you speak

to your classmates and teachers.

Be aware of making jokes and using sarcasm
as humour can easily be misinterpreted online.

Avoid using slang words as not everyone may
understand these.

And never use offensive language!

Proofread what you type before you press send.

And remember, the main class chat is not a
place to have private discussions!

Whether you are typing a message in the class
chat,

giving a presentation, responding on a discussion
board,

or speaking aloud in an online class,

remember to be polite and respect others’
points of view.

Show people the same courtesy online that you
would in person.

So, use these tips.

Make the most of your online classes and join
in!

Contribute your ideas and listen to others.

Ask questions and remember there are lots
of places in the university 

where you can ask for support

such as the Library, IT, and Student Connect.

I hope these tips have been helpful.

See you later!
