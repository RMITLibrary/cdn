I\'92ve got this study planner from the study and learning centre and it\'92s just next to the hub and I\'92ll show you how I basically use it. And I\'92ll ... the first thing I\'92ll do is just I\'92ll put my courses here. They\'92ve got user instructions here which you can read again. And I use one pen for one course so then it\'92s all colourful and nice. Okay so I got research properties and then contender issues. And practising development. Okay so I\'92ll put in my dates like my personal dates so holidays and that sort of stuff first \'91cause it\'92s more fun. And right so uni actually starts in March but I\'92ve got this holiday planned here so I\'92m just going to put I\'92m going to New Zealand here and coming back just before uni starts so on the Sunday here. Back from New Zealand. Probably not the best colour. Okay. So I guess the other stuff that you could put in is your work if you have a part-time job \'91cause that\'92s dates you don\'92t want to miss. Alright so I\'92ve got that already in my diary and I know I\'92ll be working on Wednesdays every week so I\'92m just going to put work like with a W so I\'92m just going to fill it for every single Wednesday on. And then holidays again from uni which is pretty important and you can get that from your diary, it\'92s got academy calendar here so around Easter I guess so got that and ...\
\
And these ones are shared so if it\'92s this colour, Brett TAFE and higher Ed out of it.\
\
Oh I see. Alright so Tuesday until ... the 1\super st\nosupersub  until the 7\super th\nosupersub  . I guess you could do something like that. Yeah. And then if you have you know you\'92re going on long weekends or something you can put them in and stuff like that just so you remember. Right so the other thing now like the courses, to get back to that, you can get these from like the Blackboard, your course guide\'92s on there and you\'92ll have like your assignment dates, when they\'92re due and your presentations you have to do, that sort of stuff and you can just put them all in. I\'92ve already put that in my diary so I\'92ve got the dates there \'91cause I don\'92t have my course guide with me so I know my first assignment is due on the 28\super th\nosupersub  of April. So that\'92s research, strategies and I put first to do or something. And then what I\'92ll do is I\'92ll just sort of draw from ... I actually start classes from March on so I\'92ll just do this so I know how long I have. It\'92s a pretty long time. But it\'92s the major assignment so what I tend to do is ... so I now have all this time here but I probably will put a little note here halfway through so I\'92ll have a draft done and then sort of you know get it checked by the teacher or something like that so I put draft and yeah the colour just tells me that it\'92s there so I avoid writing a lot over you know all over. And I just do the same for everything else basically. So gender issues is due before so here. And yeah I\'92m just putting first due but some people put task 1, task 2 or you know whatever works. I just do that again so I know.\
\
This kind of gives me an idea of you know what I should do first and how long I have and it works quite well that way. And practising, that\'92s due first week of April or around that so just after the holidays I\'92ll do that again. And then here on Wednesday and then yeah. And yeah the time\'92s are right, what percentage they are for so if it\'92s you know a 40% assignment I put it in there, kind of give me an idea of the balance I need you know how much work I need to put in and when to do them, that sort of stuff. And yeah again I got all of these from the course guides from Blackboard. I\'92ve got some birthday dates in my diary again \'91cause I don\'92t remember them so I\'92ve got 19\super th\nosupersub  of April is my brother\'92s birthday so just put bro\'92s birthday and draw a little gig. And yeah you keep filling it in with things like that and I suppose what I do as well which helps me a lot is I know this is week 1 like I\'92ve you know the first semester so I do and things like that like week 1, week 2 and it just helps me kind of keep track of my weeks and then you know the months and sort of that sort of stuff. Yeah. Well and then you know you could stick that on your wall. It\'92s there and it\'92s colourful and it makes things more fun.\
