Narration: 
\b0 When do you need to reference? One answer is a lot more often than many students think at first. In an essay or assignment at tertiary level, a student is required to synthesise information from a variety of sources, and combine it into a new understanding or new interpretation. In doing so, a student needs to state where each item of information came from. This means that every sentence or two will have a reference after it or within it. A typical paragraph in a typical well-researched essay will have 3 to 4 or probably more citations within each paragraph.\
\
Most students know that you need to cite when using the exact words from somewhere else, which is known as a direct quote. However, also you need to cite a reference when you are just borrowing the information and putting it in your own words. When you summarise, or give the general gist of what you said, you still need to cite that knowledge. And, of course, if you utilise a photo or a diagram from a publication or website, you need to acknowledge where it came from, too.\
\
You don\'92t need to reference information such as who the president may be in the year 2011, or that kidneys fill the bladder to form urine. This is easily found from any source. You don\'92t need to reference information that is common knowledge within your field. However, deciding what is a commonly known fact in your field can be difficult, especially when you are just new to the field yourself. Ask a lecturer if you can, if in doubt the safe thing to do is reference it anyway. \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row

Narration: 
\b0 There are two components to any reference. There is the in-text reference. This is a brief indication in the text of the essay or assignment that the information is from another place. This is very brief, and has only minimal information. In some referencing styles, it is nothing more than just a number.\
\
The other component is the reference listing. This appears at the end of the assignment and has a lot more detail. From the reference listing, you can tell whether the information came from a book, or a journal article, or a website, or a newspaper, or a radio broadcast, and so forth.\
\
There are many types of sources of very simple reference listing. For example a book contains a lot of information, and of course it mentions the title of the book and the authors, but it also includes the year of publication, the name of the publisher, and even the city where it was published.\
\
Remember, every citation in a essay must be from the source, that is listed in the reference list. And every book or source in the reference list, must be used somewhere in the assignment. \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row

\pard\intbl\itap1\pardeftab720\sl340\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Narration: 
\b0 There are two broad categories of referencing styles. One group are know as author-date styles, and you can spot these because in the essay text, every citation consists of an author\'92s surname and a date of publication. Also, the reference list at the end will be in alphabetical order. \
\
One of the styles that belongs to this group is \'96 among others \'96 APA, which stands for the American Psychological Association. This is the style that is commonly used in the School of Nursing at RMIT.\
\
The other group of styles is the footnote or endnote group. These use just a number in the text to signify that a certain piece of information has come from another source. Footnote and endnote styles are commonly used in medical sciences, and some of the journals you will read may use the style from this referencing system. When comparing footnoting with author-date systems, one group\'92s style is no better than the other. \
\
There is a general tendency for the scientific and medical field to use footnote styles, because researchers are focused on the data and it is less important to know who particularly found or said something. The humanities tend to favour author-date systems because these fields are mainly constructed by theories, so it is very necessary to know which writer or expert has put forward a certain theory or idea.\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row

\b0  APA style: in-text referencing\
\

\b Description:
\b0  Examples of in-text referencing with a focus on two different types: subject prominent referencing and author prominent referencing.\
\
The subject prominent first example reads \'93In order to manage well, it is helpful to have the support and guidance of the wider nurse management community (Harper & Miller, 2009)\'94.\
\
The author prominent example reads \'93Harper and Miller (2009) emphasise that establishing mentorships with other nurse managers is important for effective leadership\'94.\cell 
\pard\intbl\itap1\pardeftab720\sl340\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Narration: 
\b0 This is what APA looks like in text. You can make your reference subject prominent. That means that the information comes first, and the author and date are mentioned in a bracket at the end of the borrowed information. \
\
The next sentence is similar, but this time we have not just used Harper and Miller\'92s idea, we have used their exact words. It\'92s permissible to do so, but only if their sentence emphasises the point that you want to emphasise, and you can\'92t put it better yourself. When using a direct quote, as this is, you do have to enclose the words in quotation marks, and also include the page number in the citation. For a website, you should to include the paragraph number instead.\
\
In this case, we directly quoted a whole sentence, it would be possible to quote half a sentence and finish the rest of the sentence in your own words if that suited your purpose. The other way to do an in-text citation is to make it author prominent; in this structure the author\'92s name becomes part the sentence itself. With this structure we say that Harper and Miller argue or advise or comment or state. It\'92s a good idea to have a collection of these words to pick from, because \'91state\'92 tends to get overused.\
\
This first sentence is a paraphrase, so you only need the year of publication, and that is still in brackets. The second sentence here is another direct quote, and once again, we need the page number. Note that when you use a direct quote, you have to write it exactly as you found it. However, it is permissible to change a capital letter to a lowercase letter if it suits the structure of your sentence. The capital N for \'91Networking\'92 was changed to lowercase here because the original capital N would look strange in the middle of a sentence.\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row

If the original has an spelling or grammar mistake, you are actually obliged to leave it like that, but you can use the term \'91sic\'92 which is Latin for \'93this is how it was found\'94. If you want to leave some words out that are unnecessary to the central meaning, you need to show that you have done so by using three periods, which is known as an ellipsis.\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row

Narration: 
\b0 A lot of your information will come from journal articles, and these might be in paper-based hard copy form. But these days, recent literature will most likely be in electronic form.\
\
The format for this should appear like so: the author\'92s surname initial, the date of publication, the name of the article, and then in italics, the name of the journal or professional magazine in which it appears. Following this is the volume, and in brackets the issue of the journal, which is like an numbering system of that particular journal. And then the pages or page that the article appears on. More recent electronic journal articles have a DOI number allocated to it, which is a ten to fifteen digit number that uniquely identifies the article. You will need to look for the DOI sometimes, but generally it is not too hard to find. The example here has it listed at the end of the page, but it may appear near the heading or elsewhere.\
\
Some articles still do not have DOI numbers. These tend to be articles from a few years back, from lesser known journals, from professional magazines rather than academic journals perhaps, or sometimes journals from developing countries or others that do not speak English as a primary language. In this case, do the citation as shown, giving the website address (or URL).\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row

\b0 If your course your information may come from sources outside of just books and electronic journals. It is possible to cite from a wide variety of sources, such as dictionaries, newspapers, legal reports, bureau statistics reports, brochures, radio programs, podcasts, films -just to name a few\'85 and each of these has their own specific formatting.\
\
The best thing to do is find a model example to copy. The APA 6
\fs18 \super th
\fs30 \nosupersub  edition handbook is available in the library or in the bookshop. RMIT library also has a website giving examples for more frequently used citation styles, including APA of course.\
\
In fact, many universities have a study skills department with information on APA referencing; and they are more often than not, available to everyone online. If the exact example is not available from the RMIT library pages, you may want to find a good model elsewhere on the web. We\'92re often asked at the study and learning centre, how to reference something in your lecture notes. But it is always best to go back to the more widely published book or source, where the notes can be drawn from.\
\
Your lecturer should include a reference list, with his or her lecture. It is possible to reference what someone said in a lecturer or in an email, or a chat in the corridor, and it is always better to reference it, rather than not to reference it. But RMIT lecture notes, for example, are not easily obtainable on a wider scale, so it is a better scholarship to base your information on an original published and more widely accessible sources.\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \cell \row
