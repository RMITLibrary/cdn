		<div>Additive
colour
</div>
		<div>Correct! It is subtractive colour
 
Water colour paints are mixed through the subtractive colour system where the lightwaves are either reflected or absorbed by the atoms in the paint.

If using water colour paints, you can create lighter colours by adding water which thins out the colour pigments in the paint making it more transparent so that light is reflected from the white paper underneath.

		<div>Correct! It is additive colour.

 Traditional stage lights have gel filters which are usually made from coloured heat-resistant plastics. These are placed over white lights to filter different colours of light.

In recent times, LED (Light-Emitting Diode) lights have also become popular in stage lighting because they are cheaper, use less power than light bulbs and generate less heat which is much safer. These lights can be programmed to mix millions of colours using RGB primary colours in different amounts using the additive colour system.

 Creating a logo design may start out with pencils and felt-tipped pens in the design process (subtractive colour), however, contemporary logo design for a website is constructed in a digital image editing application where graphics are coloured using a colour picker wheel or slider with RGB or HEX colour information.

		<div>Turning a website logo into a t-shirt design - is it...</div>
		<div>Correct! It is both additive and subtractive colour.

 Your logo design from the previous quiz question is created using additive colour in RGB, and you’ll need to convert that image file to CMYK colour for any printed materials like business cards, letterhead, brochures, posters, signage, or t-shirts. The printing process involves subtractive colours created by mixing inks.

 Dying your hair involves layering a coloured dye over the top of your existing hair colour. The purple dye is absorbing mostly green and yellow lightwaves and reflecting red, blue and violet lightwaves.

If you want bright purple hair and your hair is dark, you need to bleach the colour out of your hair first so it reflects more light. Dark hair absorbs a lot of light, and the purple dye will only make it darker by absorbing even more light.
Note: many permanent hair dyes contain ammonia or similar chemicals that lighten the hair while dying it to create a more vibrant colour result.
