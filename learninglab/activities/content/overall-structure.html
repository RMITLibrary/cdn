<p class="lead">There are as many structures for a report as there are reasons for writing one. The differences between reports occur chiefly in the body.</p>

       or 
      <strong>issue</strong>
       through to 
      <strong>solutions</strong>
      . The structure (headings, sub-headings) needs to be tailored to fit the context (rather than vice versa).

Social media has become a tool for potential employers to gather information and evaluate a candidate&rsquo;s suitability for a job. While this practice has become widespread, there is little in the way of systematic approaches to using social media as a recruitment tool. Expectations about social media presence are seldom explicit, and both potential employers and employees need clarity on appropriate use of this information.</span>

          <h3>Method/methodology</h3>

          			The method section of a report details how the research was conducted, the research methods used and the reasons for choosing those methods. It should:
          			
          <ul>
              <li>outline the participants and research methods used, e.g. surveys/questionnaire, interviews</li>
              <li>refer to other relevant studies.</li>
          </ul>

          			The methodology is a step-by-step explanation of the research process. It should be:
          			
          <ul>
              <li>factual</li>
              <li>mainly written in past tense.</li>
          </ul>

          			The method section of a scientific/engineering report provides:
          			
          <ul>
              <li>an explanation of the experimental procedures (so that the experiment can be repeated for validation in the future).</li>
              <li>mainly written in passive tense.</li>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>The results section of a report details the results or findings of the research. It answers the following questions:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>What happened?</li>
              <li>What was found?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is no interpretation of the results, it only states the facts.</p>
          <p>Scientific and engineering reports will be rich with visual data (tables, graphs) and minimal text. Interpretation of the results will be made in the Discussion section.</p>
          <h4>Presenting the data</h4>
          <p>
              Use visual data to summarise the results and make them easy to understand. Any data that is there to 
              <strong>explain or illustrate</strong>
               a point should be included in the text. If the data is not essential to the explanation, but 
              <strong>is supportive, then it can be an appendix</strong>
               to the report but 
              <strong>still referred to within the text</strong>
              . Dot points/bullet lists are also useful ways to present information.
          </p>
          <h4>Sample results</h4>
          <p>There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to new graduates. The results in Table 1 suggest that there is little awareness of the potential dangers of employees using personal profiles and information on social media when applying for jobs.</p>

          <h3>Discussion</h3>
          <p>The discussion section of a report interprets the results of the research. It is here that the findings are woven together and the major issues/themes are identified and discussed. The discussion section aims to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>state/identify the main research findings/themes</li>
              <li>interpret and weave the results together to show what they mean</li>
              <li>link the results to other research.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Identifying the major themes in the results will help structure the discussion. This will keep the report focussed on specific points that have developed from the data or research. This helps to clarify identifiable outcomes which can often be used as headings.</p>

              <span class="color1 color1-h">[1]This study highlights the lack of awareness amongst graduate job seekers of the use of social media for recruitment. The practice of employers accessing the personal profiles of potential employees is widespread and is not considered to be an ethical issue by employers.</span>
              <span class="color2 color2-h">[2] As the data (Smith &amp; Watson, 2014) demonstrates, over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% check Facebook and Twitter when considering candidates who have applied for positions. Further, Starr&rsquo;s (2015) research of school leavers indicates that less than 25% are aware of what privacy settings they use on social media and even fewer were aware that these sites may be used for judging people for various reasons (see Appendix 2).</span>
              <span class="color3 color3-h">[3] Clearly, the job seeking public needs to be made aware that employers are increasingly accessing their personal profiles on social media for recruitment purposes. Educating the public on the consequences of this recruitment practice needs to start early.</span>

              <p>
                  <span class="color1 color1-h">[1] Usage of social media in recruitment is widely established and expected to increase as social media becomes further integrated with business and personal lifestyles.</span>
                   Current research has found that over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% engage with Facebook and Twitter when making decisions about the appropriateness of prospective employees. However results show that graduates were sufficiently aware or alarmed by this practice and the potential discriminatory effect on their employment opportunities.

          <ul>
              <li>
                  <p>There is a need for a program of awareness raising among graduates approaching the job market. A large percentage of millennial job seekers surveyed do not realise the extent that their social media profiles can affect their future prospects and such awareness raising could be incorporated into Careers and Employment programs within universities.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Awareness of these issues should be introduced in the early years of a course. This would allow students to cultivate career appropriate social media profiles and practices before these issues become crucial.</p>
